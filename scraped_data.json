            "“If you’re taking these drugs, really, really pay attention to your protein consumption and your resistance training. . .that’s obviously going to be an important part of being on the right side of that body composition curve.”— Peter Attia",
            "“In humans, klotho is indeed a longevity gene. More klotho from the gene means longer life, better cognition. Take it away, shorter life, worse cognition.” —Peter Attia",
            "“You see all these three things—the speed, heart rate, and power. Then you see how you feel and which zone are you really in.” —Tadej Pogačar",

Unfortunately, ourcurrent healthcare systemis primarily geared toward helping you live longer once you develop chronic disease. This, of course, is the opposite of the approach I take with my patients.",
            "Over 80% of deaths in people over 50 who do not smoke can be grouped into 4 main categories, what I like to call thefour horsemen of chronic disease. These are: (1)atherosclerotic disease(comprised of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease), (2)cancer, (3)neurodegenerative disease(Alzheimer’s disease being the most common), and (4)metabolic disease(a spectrum of everything from hyperinsulinemia toinsulin resistanceto fatty liver disease to type 2 diabetes).",

            "What is Insulin Resistance?When tissues become less responsive to the effects of insulin, the pancreas must produce more and more insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis; this state is the definition of insulin resistance. IR has long been infamous for its central role in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes, but we now know that IR is also involved in the development of a host of other life-threatening conditions.",
            "How can we prevent IR from developing, and can it be reversed?IR has long been infamous for its central role in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes, but we now know that IR is also involved in the development of a host of other life-threatening conditions, ranging fromatherosclerotic cardiovascular diseasetoAlzheimer’s diseasetocancerto fatty liver disease. These threats underscore the critical importance of IR prevention and mitigation (or even reversal) as part of the effort toward extending lifespan and healthspan.",

            "Many of us use body weight or BMI (body mass index) for a quick approximation of our health status.Yet the utility of these metrics is limitedbecause they provide little information about a far more relevant parameter: body composition – and in particular, body fat and its distribution. Body weight and BMI alone do not discriminate betweenmuscle mass(which we want to maintain or increase to promote longevity) andfat mass(which we generally want to keep relatively low). Thus, when we set a goal to “lose weight,” our real aim ought to be losing fat.",
            "Losing fat mass isn’t necessarily easy, but unfortunately, that struggle pales in comparison to the challenge ofkeeping it off. This is caused in large part by ahormone called leptin, which is secreted by fat cells and plays a critical role in numerous endocrine pathways and functions, including the regulation of energy homeostasis. Leptin is secreted at levels proportional to body fat and acts as a “satiety hormone” in the brain, causing a reduction in food intake. However, as leptin signaling decreases – due to fat loss or to key neurons becoming leptin-resistant – the brain interprets this as a sign of starvation, and drives increased appetite and reduced energy expenditure to counteract the loss.",
            "The content selections below provide more information on theaccumulation and measurement of body fat,different types of fat and their relative impacts on health, andthe effects of leptin on appetite and metabolism.",

This includes declining any compensation that would create an incentive to be a “paid face” of an organization or brand.",

He received his medical degree from the Stanford University School of Medicine and trained for five years at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in general surgery, where he was the recipient of the resident of the year award. He helps his patients lengthen their lifespan while  improving their healthspan.",

            "Through a structured set of activities, simulated patient conversations, and original video content,Earlywill guide you through a one-of-a-kind journey empowering you to take charge of your longevity.",
            "What are the risks –specific to you– that stand in the way of achieving your longevity goals?",
            "Utilizing resources developed in Peter’s private practice, you will build a nuanced, personalized understanding of the risks that you will need to manage on your longevity journey.",
            "What must youdoin order to manage your risks to achieve your longevity goals?",
            "Whether you are just starting your longevity journey, or have been focusing on it for decades,Earlywill guide you through the creation of a personalized plan across each of Peter’s five tactical domains.",
            "What does it really mean to optimize your longevity? We define longevity as a function of two things: lifespan (how long you live) and healthspan (how well you live). Longevity is not just about living longer, it’s about reducing the amount of time you spend in the final stages of decline by “squaring your longevity curve.”",
            "ThroughEarlyyou will learn what to do in order to live a longer, better life.",
            "Earlyaddresses the most essential question you are confronted with in life —how can I live better for longer? For those willing to do the work, this program is fully capable of changing the trajectory of both your healthspan and your lifespan.",

            "Still need help? Contact us atsupport@earlymedical.com.",
            "What isEarly?At its core,Earlyis an intensive 12-module program that provides you with the education and tools necessary to engineer your own longevity playbook from start to finish.",
            "Earlyissui generis. It has no peer. This does not mean there are no other places to find information related to the applied science of longevity. It means that we are unaware of any other means by which one can learn, in a complete and comprehensive way and, most importantly, translate that learning into actionable steps to achieve the desired outcome – living better and living longer.",
            "Why did you createEarly?Earlywas created as a response to one of the most common questions we have been asked over the past few years: “How can I become a patient in your practice?”",
            "The answer to this question is that, for many reasons, the practice cannot accommodate a large number of patients.",
            "So, while there is no direct doctor/patient relationship with Peter or our clinical staff,Earlyaims to be the next best thing – an organized, exhaustive, and actionable plan designed to put you in the driver’s seat of your own longevity journey.",
            "Why is it calledEarly?The nameEarlycame from one of our patients, and it refers to two very important things about anyone’s health journey: 1) the importance of being early to act, and 2) being early to adopt new knowledge.",
            "How isEarlydifferent from the podcast, weekly newsletter, and everything else currently available?",
            "There are many ways in whichEarlydifferentiates itself from the podcast and newsletter; however, the most significant difference is its purpose.",
            "The purpose of the podcast is to learn from subject matter experts on various topics related to longevity. The podcast does not follow an organizational pattern and it can be difficult for someone to make sense of the previous five years worth of content.",
            "This is whereEarlydeparts from our typical content. It is purposefully organized around an objective. The objective is to provide each participant with the information and tasks, in chronological order, necessary to change the arc of their healthspan and lifespan.",
            "The 12 modules are structured, both in terms of video content and written content, to take you through a journey similar to that which a patient might experience in our practice.",
            "The most important element that we’ve built intoEarlyis actionable content. Over the years, we have heard from many listeners of the podcast, especially in response to very technical content, that it is difficult to know how to act on what they have learned.Earlyis our response to this concern and is designed to be highly actionable.",
            "Do I get direct contact with Peter or one of the physicians throughEarly?",
            "As much as we wish that our clinical team could treat each of our dedicated supporters, this is simply not possible. Enrollment inEarlydoes not provide a direct relationship between participants and Peter, or our clinical team, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.",
            "With that said,Earlywas designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate your own longevity journey without a physician, when possible. The program also aims to help you skillfully navigate your interactions with the medical system, when necessary.",
            "How much content is in the program?Earlyconsists of more than 100 videos, totaling more than 25 hours of original content, available exclusively in theEarlyprogram, and hundreds of supporting documents and resources that help you apply what you have learned in your own life.",
            "How long does it take to go throughEarly?",
            "This will be different for everyone. The time each participant can dedicate to the program material on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis is variable.",
            "Earlywas designed to take approximately 1 year to go through, and act on, the material provided. Some modules (12 in total) will take longer than others. Some participants may spend more time in certain modules than others based on their individual needs, or challenges they uncover in the process. With that said, theEarlyprogram is best viewed as a lifelong endeavor. Our health and circumstances change as time passes andEarlyis a resource you can come back to indefinitely. Longevity is a process, rather than a destination, andEarlycan serve as the post to which you tether your longevity journey.",
            "You will get the most out of this program if you go through it in chronological order (don’t skip ahead), and take the time necessary to ensure you understand the content and complete the action items associated with each module.",
            "IsEarlyapplicable for anyone regardless of age or sex?",
            "Yes. We designedEarlyto have broad application for people of different ages, current health statuses, predispositions, and more. Generally speaking, everyone should be able to benefit from the program material.",
            "With that said, it is unlikely you’ll find your exact set of health circumstances addressed in the program. Rather, our hope is that you’ll see you have something in common with each of the scenarios presented in the program and, in turn, be able to string those commonalities together to engineer a longevity playbook that is tailored to you, specifically.",
            "Can I get value from the content if I don’t live in the U.S.?Yes. The videos and associated content inEarlywill work for people anywhere in the world. In module 5 of the program we provide a few resources to help people run their labs if they are not able to do them through their doctor (at direct cost to the user). At this time, these resources are only available for people living in the U.S.",
            "How much is this program?Earlyis a one-time fee of $2,500 USD.",
            "Why does it cost more than other online health programs, is it really worth that much?",
            "We spent a great deal of time thinking through pricing forEarly. It is not lost on us that the price exceeds other online “health programs.” However,Earlyis not like other programs, for the reasons stated above.",
            "Earlyaddresses the most essential question you are confronted with in life—how can you live better for longer? For those willing to do the work, this program is fully capable of changing the trajectory of both your healthspan and your lifespan.",
            "We can’t tell you whether or not the benefits of this program outweigh the cost, especially if you amortize them over your life as you should amortize the benefits over your life. Only you can make that assessment. However, we can say with certainty that we designed this program specifically with the goal that the answer to that question would be a resounding “Yes.”",
            "Are the cost of labs included in the program?",
            "In module 5 ofEarly, we provide a list of labs that we typically run on our patients, the reference ranges that we like to see, and a template for you to track your data based on past results and any future labs you decide to run. The cost of running these labs is not included in the program.",
            "For U.S.-based customers, we’ve provided options for getting these labs if you are not able to do them through your doctor, including one option which offers labs at provider-pricing. Note that your ability to access these services varies state-to-state depending on the laws of your state. For all these options, we want to be very clear we do not stand to profit or benefit financially from the referral whatsoever. We receive zero kickback from any lab.",
            "Does the one-time fee provide access to the content for a defined period of time? Will the content continually be updated as new information is known?The one-time fee provides for ongoing access to theEarlycontent as it is currently structured, and is not an ongoing subscription charge. Our vision is to continually evolve this product with additional content and, more importantly, additional capabilities to assist you in achieving your longevity goals. At this time, we’re not 100% sure what that looks like. One of the reasons we want to get the program launched is so that we can get real-world feedback on where you might struggle in achieving your longevity goals so that we may better support you.",
            "Earlyis terrific. It consolidates Peter’s work and fills in gaps from other formats in a way that is easily understandable, actionable, and can be translated into each family member’s personal situation.  For those of us who can’t have Peter as their physician,Earlyis the next best thing.",
            "I have been aDrivelistener since episode 18 and have loved every minute of it.Earlyis a completely different experience that is proving to be hugely valuable to me. Thanks for all of the tremendous work that has gone into it.  It is worth every penny!",
            "Really enjoying the program so far. I’m pretty deep in much of the content from Peter’s and other podcasts and was a bit worried I wouldn’t get anything “new” for my investment however, I’m impressed with the program and the incremental information on theEarlyapproach and tools.  Really brings the “how to” to the forefront!",

Annie breaks down the decision-making matrix, revealing how we often focus too narrowly on just one of the four quadrants, missing out on valuable learning opportunities in the remaining 75% of situations. She delves into how our tendency to evaluate only negative outcomes leads to a culture of risk aversion. This mindset, she argues, stifles the kind of bold decision-making necessary for progress and innovation across various fields, from poker and sports to business and medicine. Annie also introduces a robust framework for learning and the levels of thought required to excel in any domain. Finally, she discusses a strategy called âbackcastingâ, a concept that resonated deeply with Peter in terms of how he thinks about extending healthspan.  We discuss:   Annieâs background, favorite sports teams, and Peterâs affinity for Bill Belichick [1:30]; Chess vs. poker: Which is a better metaphor for decision-making in life (and medicine)? [6:45]; Thinking probabilistically: Why we arenât wired that way, and how you can improve it for better decision-making [12:30]; Variable reinforcement: The psychological draw of poker that keeps people playing [19:15]; The role of luck and skill in poker (and other sports), and the difference between looking at the short run vs. long run [32:15]; A brief explanation of Texas hold âem [41:00]; The added complexity of reading the behavior of others players in poker [47:30]; Why Annie likes to âquit fast,â and why poker is still popular despite the power of loss aversion [52:45]; Limit vs. no-limit poker, and how the game has changed with growing popularity [55:15]; The advent of analytics to poker, and why Annie would get crushed against todayâs professionals [1:04:45]; The decision matrix, and the âresultingâ heuristic: The simplifier we use to judge the quality of decisions âThe Pete Carroll Superbowl play call example [1:10:30]; The personal and societal consequences of avoiding bad outcomes [1:21:45]; Poker as a model system for life [1:31:30]; How many leaders are making (and encouraging) status-quo decisions, and how Bill Belichickâs decision-making changed after winning two Super Bowls [1:35:15]; What did we learn about decision-making from the Y2K nothingburger?

Peter covers the latest findings in this rapidly evolving landscape, including new insights into their long-term efficacy, side effects, and what happens when the drug is discontinued. Peter also explores their impact on body composition and how resistance training interacts with these treatments. Additionally, he compares different GLP-1 receptor agonists and discusses promising new drugs in the pipeline. Finally, Peter addresses questions about the role of compounding pharmacies in the GLP-1 agonist market, compares oral vs. injectable options, and provides key considerations for anyone deciding whether to use a GLP-1 agonist for weight loss.

Annie breaks down the decision-making matrix, revealing how we often focus too narrowly on just one of the four quadrants, missing out on valuable learning opportunities in the remaining 75% of situations. She delves into how our tendency to evaluate only negative outcomes leads to a culture of risk aversion. This mindset, she argues, stifles the kind of bold decision-making necessary for progress and innovation across various fields, from poker and sports to business and medicine. Annie also introduces a robust framework for learning and the levels of thought required to excel in any domain. Finally, she discusses a strategy called âbackcastingâ, a concept that resonated deeply with Peter in terms of how he thinks about extending healthspan.

            "In part 1 of this 3 part series, Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience at UC Berkeley and expert on sleep, describes the different stages, and cycles, of sleep, including what he calls the 4 pillars of sleep, and how they contribute to memory consolidation and numerous important pathways to mental health. We also get into the dangers of chronic sleep deprivation, such as the development of dementia, and the more acute dangers of sleep deprivation like fatal car crashes which are most often caused by drowsy driving. We also discuss the different and important roles of REM vs. non-REM sleep, and the impact that bad sleep habits can have specifically on those sleep stages.",

Unfortunately, as a couple people have commented, I’m terrified of what is going to happen to me, as sleep has become my biggest problem ever since I hit perimenopause, despite taking oral progesterone. I having been losing this battle ever since it started over a year ago. Is there anyone studying this right now? Doing clinical studies as to exactly what is REALLY going on–what neurotransmitters, hormones (or other factors) are related? What medications (if any) work best? What helps more: estrogen? progesterone? both? WHY can’t we sleep? The lack of it has become my biggest living nightmare. Learning about the effects of sleep deprivation only cause more frustration as I am at a loss to control this. If I were granted only one wish right now, it would be the ability to sleep as I used to and wake up actually feeling refreshed. Perhaps it’s simply too complicated to study.",

Do they turn off the WiFI at night? Better yet, do they shut off all the electrical circuits that surround the sleeping space?

This was a great source of knowledge for me and at times, I found the podcasts quite frightening.My accumulated knowledge on how to get a good night of sleep is now making me anxious. I worry that this anxiety deprives me of sufficient sleep and thus can limit my academic and sporting performance. For example, if I have had 3 consecutive nights of poor sleep prior to a half-marathon, I tend to believe that my performance will be subconsciously limited, over which I will have no control.I wonder if I would be better off not knowing too much information about sleep rather than having sleepless nights over it, knowing that I won’t get a good night’s sleep. I would appreciate hearing your opinion on this matter.",

It is hard to imagine one could listen to over six hours of talk on sleep and not fall asleep at some point, but truthfully, it has been a joy. Matthew Walker is incredibly lucid and  his clarity of thought is remarkable indeed. I love it when a person speaks without rushing into it and you can almost visualize his thoughts as he verbalizes them. I bought six copies of his book and gave them to my near and dear, liked it so much.It is absolutely true that we neglect our sleep, at our own peril.

Unfortunately, as a couple people have commented, I’m terrified of what is going to happen to me, as sleep has become my biggest problem ever since I hit perimenopause, despite taking oral progesterone. I having been losing this battle ever since it started over a year ago. Is there anyone studying this right now? Doing clinical studies as to exactly what is REALLY going on–what neurotransmitters, hormones (or other factors) are related? What medications (if any) work best? What helps more: estrogen? progesterone? both? WHY can’t we sleep? The lack of it has become my biggest living nightmare. Learning about the effects of sleep deprivation only cause more frustration as I am at a loss to control this. If I were granted only one wish right now, it would be the ability to sleep as I used to and wake up actually feeling refreshed. Perhaps it’s simply too complicated to study.Cicely Stewartsays:July 12, 2020 at 12:47 pmOMG, what Tempa Hull said exactly! It’s unbelievably maddening as I have perfected my diet and lifestyle to help me sleep, but it is all to no avail while I’ve been stuck in perimenopause hell for several years now. Please please do a podcast on this or at least ask Matthew Walker to answer this question!",

Many electrosensitive people cannot get into REM sleep until all the influences of EMR are removed. How many people that complain about their lack of sleep have their mobile phones by their bedside? Do they turn off the WiFI at night? Better yet, do they shut off all the electrical circuits that surround the sleeping space? Many of my clients are surprised and delighted with a good night’s sleep after they follow these simple instructions. Technology is a wonderful thing but it is killing us in many ways.",

Rick begins by talking about the relationship between salt and high blood pressure, then provides a masterclass into uric acid, and then expertly reveals the mechanisms and pathways by which sugar (specifically fructose) can profoundly impact metabolic health. From there, he explains how he applies this information to real life patients as well as touches on some of the most promising ideas around pharmacotherapy that are being developed in response to the epidemics of fatty liver, insulin resistance, diabetes, and obesity. Furthermore, Rick gives his take onartificial sweetenerscompared to real sugar, discusses cancer’s affinity for fructose, and much more.",

He’s lectured across 40 countries, authored two books, including The Fat Switch, and has been funded extensively by the National Institute of Health (NIH).

I could see uric acid having correlation with metabolic symptoms.  However, if uric acid is part of the “switch”, how do we explain people that eat healthy and show no signs of metabolic symptoms but have high uric acid?  Vice versa; those that have low uric acid but show metabolic symptoms.  For many of us, no matter how much we exercise or eat healthy, uric acid number does not change significantly.  There are several papers that suggest food has minimal effect on uric acid number.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30305269/On the topic of Umami.  Japanese people eat lots of umami infused food, but their uric acid level and diabetic cases are relatively low.  More reasons I feel that food has minimal effect on uric acid level.",

What I wanted to know was Peter’s candid thoughts on some of Dr. Johnson’s key claims.  I could see uric acid having correlation with metabolic symptoms.  However, if uric acid is part of the “switch”, how do we explain people that eat healthy and show no signs of metabolic symptoms but have high uric acid?  Vice versa; those that have low uric acid but show metabolic symptoms.  For many of us, no matter how much we exercise or eat healthy, uric acid number does not change significantly.  There are several papers that suggest food has minimal effect on uric acid number.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30305269/On the topic of Umami.  Japanese people eat lots of umami infused food, but their uric acid level and diabetic cases are relatively low.

Peter tackles subjects like the viability of living to 120 and beyond, addressing some of the optimistic theories regarding achievement of this remarkable feat. Peter then shares his drug and supplement regimen while emphasizing how individualized these protocols need to be. The conversation also touches on lowering apoB, the long-term use of statins, the myth of good vs. bad cholesterol, the complexities of nutrition research, the quest for the ideal diet, and Peter’s strategies for hitting daily protein goals. Peter finishes with a discussion about his favorite health-tracking wearables, the role of CGM in non-diabetics, and more.",

            "In one of the AMAs from 2018 or 2019, Bob Kaplan is asking Peter questions and creatine comes up. Peter said he was not taking creatine at the time, but Bob was taking creatine (~5g per day). Much later (not sure exactly which episode #) and probably after the episode with Layne Norton, Peter said he was taking creatine at 5g per day. In episode #276, Peter did not say anything about taking creatine as part of his current supplements, so it seems he is not taking creatine anymore.",
            "I was interested in creatine monohydrate for exercise and strength benefits. The only major downside appeared to be weight gain. However, after trying creatine monohydrate in practice, I had side effects while using the compound. I bought a Creapure product because the creatine is made in Germany and the reputation was good as far as I could see (no lab test to verify). I have trust that that the Creapure product I received was pure creatine monohydrate. My guess is I will get side effects with any creatine product. The side effects include substantial headache an hour or two after taking the supplement, and I felt some subtle (occasional, not constant) cardiac arrhythmia or palpitation. The creatine did improve exercise performance but it was not worth the side effects. Also I tried lower doses of approx 2.5g and 1.5g. The side effects were slightly reduced at lower doses but still unpleasant.",
            "I stopped taking creatine. Instead I am taking L-citrulline for exercise performance. I have not experienced any negative side effects from taking L-citrulline. I am using a product sourced from Kyowa Hakko. Hey Nick or Drive Team, would you consider asking Peter about L-citrulline on a future AMA? I read that eating beets provides similar benefits to citrulline and arginine. The only tradeoff I can see is that arginine and leucine activate TOR. Citrulline can be used in multiple pathways. My understanding is a lot of citrulline is converted to arginine. I’m guessing that if major exercise is performed it far outweighs any impact on TOR.",

Articles hit my newsfeed the day after I listened to the podcast, trumpeting about which supplements longevity experts take. One even listed Peter’s name in the headline. I didn’t click them, but I assume all the careful context and perspective Peter works so hard to bake into this topic was left out.",

                    "Sub Stacksays:October 26, 2023 at 11:36 pmIn one of the AMAs from 2018 or 2019, Bob Kaplan is asking Peter questions and creatine comes up. Peter said he was not taking creatine at the time, but Bob was taking creatine (~5g per day). Much later (not sure exactly which episode #) and probably after the episode with Layne Norton, Peter said he was taking creatine at 5g per day. In episode #276, Peter did not say anything about taking creatine as part of his current supplements, so it seems he is not taking creatine anymore.I was interested in creatine monohydrate for exercise and strength benefits. The only major downside appeared to be weight gain. However, after trying creatine monohydrate in practice, I had side effects while using the compound. I bought a Creapure product because the creatine is made in Germany and the reputation was good as far as I could see (no lab test to verify). I have trust that that the Creapure product I received was pure creatine monohydrate. My guess is I will get side effects with any creatine product. The side effects include substantial headache an hour or two after taking the supplement, and I felt some subtle (occasional, not constant) cardiac arrhythmia or palpitation. The creatine did improve exercise performance but it was not worth the side effects. Also I tried lower doses of approx 2.5g and 1.5g. The side effects were slightly reduced at lower doses but still unpleasant.I stopped taking creatine. Instead I am taking L-citrulline for exercise performance. I have not experienced any negative side effects from taking L-citrulline. I am using a product sourced from Kyowa Hakko. Hey Nick or Drive Team, would you consider asking Peter about L-citrulline on a future AMA? I read that eating beets provides similar benefits to citrulline and arginine. The only tradeoff I can see is that arginine and leucine activate TOR. Citrulline can be used in multiple pathways. My understanding is a lot of citrulline is converted to arginine. I’m guessing that if major exercise is performed it far outweighs any impact on TOR.Thanks Peter for telling about your supplements.",

But looking at the two different mfg. sites, it seems they are different.Question 1: Is SlowMag mag L-threonate?The Show Notes say it is, but the mfg site never uses that term. Just says it’s mag chloride.Question 2: Possible typo in the Show Notes?The Show Notes say: “Peter takes SlowMag (brand) magnesium L-threonate THROUGH magnesium oxide”SlowMag site says “SlowMag is formulated with magnesium chloride for increased absorption VERSUS magnesium oxide.”Just wondering which statement is correct.Many thanks to Peter for discussing his current supplement routine. I understand why it’s an irratating topic. Articles hit my newsfeed the day after I listened to the podcast, trumpeting about which supplements longevity experts take. One even listed Peter’s name in the headline. I didn’t click them, but I assume all the careful context and perspective Peter works so hard to bake into this topic was left out.I’m not blindly following his routine.

Iñigo provides a masterclass into the many different energy system pathways, the various fuel sources (including the misunderstood lactate), the six zones of exercise training, and the parameters he uses to measure metabolic health. Additionally, he highlights the power of zone 2 training in its ability to act as a powerful diagnostic tool, and perhaps more importantly as a treatment for mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction.",

Iñigo has also been a consultant in exercise physiology and sports medicine to international organizations like the US Olympic Committee and the International Cycling Union. He has been a pioneer in developing new methodologies for monitoring athletes at the metabolic and physiological level including a novel method to measure mitochondrial function and metabolic flexibility as well as the invention of the first method to measure skeletal muscle glycogen in a non-invasive way using high frequency ultrasound. Previously, Inigo was a competitive athlete and played soccer for 6 years for Real Madrid soccer academy team as well as raced as a professional cyclist for 2 years. He also returns to Spain every summer to run with the bulls. [ucdenver.edu]",

He starts by defining the “marginal decade” and how that shapes his training for the events and activities that make up his personal centenarian decathlon. Peter explains how he coaches patients through the challenges of customizing their own list and building out a training plan, including how to set fitness goals early in life in preparation for the marginal decade. From there, he dives into training within the four pillars (zone 2, VO2 max, stability, and strength), including the minimum effective dose, how to split your time, his personal protocols, and other considerations. Additionally, he touches on bone mineral density, female-specific considerations, working through injuries, and the profound impact training can have on the overall quality of life.",

At 75, I have been  a exerciser/weight trainer for over 50 years… and still at 75, I suddenly started to notice alarming changes.  Dr Attia has helped me understand the changes and empowered me to do the best I can to run back up that descending escalator. My work-out has improved; my health has improved and his section on emotional health inspired me to work on increasing peace and acceptance in my life– to the benefit of myself and all those around me.

At 75, I have been  a exerciser/weight trainer for over 50 years… and still at 75, I suddenly started to notice alarming changes.  Dr Attia has helped me understand the changes and empowered me to do the best I can to run back up that descending escalator. My work-out has improved; my health has improved and his section on emotional health inspired me to work on increasing peace and acceptance in my life– to the benefit of myself and all those around me.

            "In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter delves into the critical subject of blood pressure, which is one of the three primary causes of atherosclerosis, along with high apoB and smoking. He begins by unraveling the nature of high blood pressure, its prevalence, and why it often goes undiagnosed. Peter describes in detail the proper way to accurately measure blood pressure and what determines a diagnosis. Next, Peter discusses the actionable steps one can take in response to high blood pressure, shedding light on the extent to which factors like weight loss, exercise, and nutrition can make an impact. He also explores the pharmacological options available and offers valuable insights on how to approach them.",

            "Are there any studies (comparable to the Sprint study) which evaluated causes and risks of elevated diastolic with normal systolic levels?  I frequently measure in the 80-82 range, sometimes 84, for diastolic even when systolic is below 120, even well below (98-101).  Is elevated diastolic any more or less indicative of primary or secondary hypertension than elevated systolic, i.e., is deeper testing appropriate?",
            "Interested in this as well. A family member (66 yo) tends to have elevated diastolic pressure mainly but both sys and diastolic can be elevated at times (lives a healthy lifestyle). MD hasn’t investigated the cause thoroughly, no renal/adrenal/thyroid workups, just an echo which revealed concentric lt ventricular hypertrophy, grade 1 left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. lt atrium mildly dilated. Could this be the primary cause or the result of years of high pressure?",

That means the methodology used in Sprint would be the standard for measuring the blood pressure.  They used automated cuffs in the study.  I have found that in highly muscular people the automated cuffs will read high, but in typical arm diameters it will read the same or lower than a manual reading.",
            "I would be interested in Peter’s comments about isolated systolic hypertension, which I believe is common in people my age (approaching 70) and older. If, for example, someone typically has blood pressure of 130/70, is it best not to push it lower with medication? I believe that I have read that loss of elasticity in the aorta is the most common cause of a large gap between systolic and diastolic pressures because it impairs the buffering of each pulse. Are there risks of low diastolic pressure in older patients that go beyond syncope and justify tolerating systolic on the high side?",

Post Covid vaccine my Bo went from a lifetime of 120/72 pulse 65 to 165/110 pulse 95. I hope there’s someone who has an approach that looks at non typical cases. 6 months of NAD+ has dropped it to 140/100 pulse 80 and now I’m told that’s normal for a 61yo male.Frustrated",
                    "HRBsays:June 12, 2023 at 7:39 pmCan you speak to the impact of aldosterone on blood pressure and potential nutritional and pharmacological interventions to block it (for example Eplerenone).  Is there a relationship between hyperaldosteronism and insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome?",
                    "Garrett Ghentsays:June 13, 2023 at 6:27 amYou should mention that the risk reduction for dementia in SPRINT MIND did not reach the level of statistical significance.",
                    "Cynthia Burmansays:June 13, 2023 at 8:19 amAre there any studies (comparable to the Sprint study) which evaluated causes and risks of elevated diastolic with normal systolic levels?  I frequently measure in the 80-82 range, sometimes 84, for diastolic even when systolic is below 120, even well below (98-101).  Is elevated diastolic any more or less indicative of primary or secondary hypertension than elevated systolic, i.e., is deeper testing appropriate?Stella Ksays:June 13, 2023 at 10:14 pmInterested in this as well. A family member (66 yo) tends to have elevated diastolic pressure mainly but both sys and diastolic can be elevated at times (lives a healthy lifestyle). MD hasn’t investigated the cause thoroughly, no renal/adrenal/thyroid workups, just an echo which revealed concentric lt ventricular hypertrophy, grade 1 left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. lt atrium mildly dilated. Could this be the primary cause or the result of years of high pressure?",

                    "Jeffrey Doolittlesays:June 13, 2023 at 9:22 amYou made the comment that automated readings are higher than manual.  That may be true in certain individuals, but as a whole the opposite has been found to be true: Comparing Automated Office Blood Pressure Readings With Other Methods of Blood Pressure Measurement for Identifying Patients With Possible Hypertension: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis  Michael Roerecke 1, Janusz Kaczorowski 2, Martin G Myers 3 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30715088/)   The American College of Cardiology used Sprint as the gold standard, and it appears you are also using it as your gold standard.  That means the methodology used in Sprint would be the standard for measuring the blood pressure.  They used automated cuffs in the study.  I have found that in highly muscular people the automated cuffs will read high, but in typical arm diameters it will read the same or lower than a manual reading.",
                    "Paul Turnersays:June 13, 2023 at 3:14 pmI would be interested in Peter’s comments about isolated systolic hypertension, which I believe is common in people my age (approaching 70) and older. If, for example, someone typically has blood pressure of 130/70, is it best not to push it lower with medication? I believe that I have read that loss of elasticity in the aorta is the most common cause of a large gap between systolic and diastolic pressures because it impairs the buffering of each pulse. Are there risks of low diastolic pressure in older patients that go beyond syncope and justify tolerating systolic on the high side?",

            "Peter Attia, MD, is the founder of Early Medical. He received his medical degree from the Stanford University School of Medicine and trained for five years at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in general surgery, where he was the recipient of the resident of the year award. He helps his patients lengthen their lifespan while  improving their healthspan.",

            "How can you live better, for longer?",
            "Through a structured set of activities, simulated patient conversations, and original video content,Earlywill guide you through a one-of-a-kind journey empowering you to take charge of your longevity.",
            "What are the risks –specific to you– that stand in the way of achieving your longevity goals?",
            "Utilizing resources developed in Peter’s private practice, you will build a nuanced, personalized understanding of the risks that you will need to manage on your longevity journey.",
            "What must youdoin order to manage your risks to achieve your longevity goals?",
            "Whether you are just starting your longevity journey, or have been focusing on it for decades,Earlywill guide you through the creation of a personalized plan across each of Peter’s five tactical domains.",
            "What does it really mean to optimize your longevity? We define longevity as a function of two things: lifespan (how long you live) and healthspan (how well you live). Longevity is not just about living longer, it’s about reducing the amount of time you spend in the final stages of decline by “squaring your longevity curve.”",
            "ThroughEarlyyou will learn what to do in order to live a longer, better life.",
            "Earlyaddresses the most essential question you are confronted with in life —how can I live better for longer? For those willing to do the work, this program is fully capable of changing the trajectory of both your healthspan and your lifespan.",

            "$2,500 USD",
            "Still need help? Contact us atsupport@earlymedical.com.",
            "What isEarly?At its core,Earlyis an intensive 12-module program that provides you with the education and tools necessary to engineer your own longevity playbook from start to finish.",
            "Earlyissui generis. It has no peer. This does not mean there are no other places to find information related to the applied science of longevity. It means that we are unaware of any other means by which one can learn, in a complete and comprehensive way and, most importantly, translate that learning into actionable steps to achieve the desired outcome – living better and living longer.",
            "Why did you createEarly?Earlywas created as a response to one of the most common questions we have been asked over the past few years: “How can I become a patient in your practice?”",
            "The answer to this question is that, for many reasons, the practice cannot accommodate a large number of patients.",
            "So, while there is no direct doctor/patient relationship with Peter or our clinical staff,Earlyaims to be the next best thing – an organized, exhaustive, and actionable plan designed to put you in the driver’s seat of your own longevity journey.",
            "Why is it calledEarly?The nameEarlycame from one of our patients, and it refers to two very important things about anyone’s health journey: 1) the importance of being early to act, and 2) being early to adopt new knowledge.",
            "How isEarlydifferent from the podcast, weekly newsletter, and everything else currently available?",
            "There are many ways in whichEarlydifferentiates itself from the podcast and newsletter; however, the most significant difference is its purpose.",
            "The purpose of the podcast is to learn from subject matter experts on various topics related to longevity. The podcast does not follow an organizational pattern and it can be difficult for someone to make sense of the previous five years worth of content.",
            "This is whereEarlydeparts from our typical content. It is purposefully organized around an objective. The objective is to provide each participant with the information and tasks, in chronological order, necessary to change the arc of their healthspan and lifespan.",
            "The 12 modules are structured, both in terms of video content and written content, to take you through a journey similar to that which a patient might experience in our practice.",
            "The most important element that we’ve built intoEarlyis actionable content. Over the years, we have heard from many listeners of the podcast, especially in response to very technical content, that it is difficult to know how to act on what they have learned.Earlyis our response to this concern and is designed to be highly actionable.",
            "Do I get direct contact with Peter or one of the physicians throughEarly?",
            "As much as we wish that our clinical team could treat each of our dedicated supporters, this is simply not possible. Enrollment inEarlydoes not provide a direct relationship between participants and Peter, or our clinical team, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.",
            "With that said,Earlywas designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate your own longevity journey without a physician, when possible. The program also aims to help you skillfully navigate your interactions with the medical system, when necessary.",
            "How much content is in the program?Earlyconsists of more than 100 videos, totaling more than 25 hours of original content, available exclusively in theEarlyprogram, and hundreds of supporting documents and resources that help you apply what you have learned in your own life.",
            "How long does it take to go throughEarly?",
            "This will be different for everyone. The time each participant can dedicate to the program material on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis is variable.",
            "Earlywas designed to take approximately 1 year to go through, and act on, the material provided. Some modules (12 in total) will take longer than others. Some participants may spend more time in certain modules than others based on their individual needs, or challenges they uncover in the process. With that said, theEarlyprogram is best viewed as a lifelong endeavor. Our health and circumstances change as time passes andEarlyis a resource you can come back to indefinitely. Longevity is a process, rather than a destination, andEarlycan serve as the post to which you tether your longevity journey.",
            "You will get the most out of this program if you go through it in chronological order (don’t skip ahead), and take the time necessary to ensure you understand the content and complete the action items associated with each module.",
            "IsEarlyapplicable for anyone regardless of age or sex?",
            "Yes. We designedEarlyto have broad application for people of different ages, current health statuses, predispositions, and more. Generally speaking, everyone should be able to benefit from the program material.",
            "With that said, it is unlikely you’ll find your exact set of health circumstances addressed in the program. Rather, our hope is that you’ll see you have something in common with each of the scenarios presented in the program and, in turn, be able to string those commonalities together to engineer a longevity playbook that is tailored to you, specifically.",
            "Can I get value from the content if I don’t live in the U.S.?Yes. The videos and associated content inEarlywill work for people anywhere in the world. In module 5 of the program we provide a few resources to help people run their labs if they are not able to do them through their doctor (at direct cost to the user). At this time, these resources are only available for people living in the U.S.",
            "How much is this program?Earlyis a one-time fee of $2,500 USD.",
            "Why does it cost more than other online health programs, is it really worth that much?",
            "We spent a great deal of time thinking through pricing forEarly. It is not lost on us that the price exceeds other online “health programs.” However,Earlyis not like other programs, for the reasons stated above.",
            "Earlyaddresses the most essential question you are confronted with in life—how can you live better for longer? For those willing to do the work, this program is fully capable of changing the trajectory of both your healthspan and your lifespan.",
            "We can’t tell you whether or not the benefits of this program outweigh the cost, especially if you amortize them over your life as you should amortize the benefits over your life. Only you can make that assessment. However, we can say with certainty that we designed this program specifically with the goal that the answer to that question would be a resounding “Yes.”",
            "Are the cost of labs included in the program?",
            "In module 5 ofEarly, we provide a list of labs that we typically run on our patients, the reference ranges that we like to see, and a template for you to track your data based on past results and any future labs you decide to run. The cost of running these labs is not included in the program.",
            "For U.S.-based customers, we’ve provided options for getting these labs if you are not able to do them through your doctor, including one option which offers labs at provider-pricing. Note that your ability to access these services varies state-to-state depending on the laws of your state. For all these options, we want to be very clear we do not stand to profit or benefit financially from the referral whatsoever. We receive zero kickback from any lab.",

Will the content continually be updated as new information is known?The one-time fee provides for ongoing access to theEarlycontent as it is currently structured, and is not an ongoing subscription charge.

It consolidates Peter’s work and fills in gaps from other formats in a way that is easily understandable, actionable, and can be translated into each family member’s personal situation.  For those of us who can’t have Peter as their physician,Earlyis the next best thing.",

I’m pretty deep in much of the content from Peter’s and other podcasts and was a bit worried I wouldn’t get anything “new” for my investment however, I’m impressed with the program and the incremental information on theEarlyapproach and tools.  Really brings the “how to” to the forefront!",
